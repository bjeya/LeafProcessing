Plants, for their growth and survival, need 13 mineral nutrients.

Toxicity or deficiency in any one or more of these nutrients affects the growth of plant and may even cause the destruction of the plant.

Hence, a constant monitoring system for tracking the nutrient status in plants becomes essential for increase in production as well as quality of yield. A diagnostic system using digital image processing would diagnose the deficiency symptoms much earlier than human eyes could recognize. This will enable the farmers to adopt appropriate remedial action in time. 

The diagnostic system would include the following components using image processing techniques

 1. Leaf area measurement
 2. Segmentation of edge and veins of the leaf
 3. Determining the Shape of the leaf
 4. Classification of the deficient mineral
 5. Determining the age of leaf
 6. Extraction of color features of the leaf
